2dAL - dotNet Data Access Layer
===============================

I'm sure the world doesn't need another data access layer but this represents some
work I was exploring with C#. Instead of using a mapping description to map from
the objects to the DB, this layer makes calls to the data object and those functions
need to perform all the manipulation.

This grew out of my continued frustration when trying to work with legacy or
wonky schema but make a nice object representation. Writing the custom mappings
seems like too much black magic.
